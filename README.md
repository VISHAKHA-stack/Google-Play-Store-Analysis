Abstract

This project aims to use the knowledge gained in Data Wrangling class on Goggle Play Store database.

Google Play is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google Inc. It serves as the official app store for the Android operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the Android SDK and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a digital media store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs.

Problem Statement:

Android is expanding as an operating system. It has captured around 74% of the total market which is a true indicator of the huge amount of population using android. Our goal is to help android developers to know what is the motivating factor for people to download an app. It will also help to find out the factors that affect someoneâ€™s decision to download an app. I would like to analyse category, reviews, price, ratings and installs for this purpose and find out how they are inter related.

Goals

The aim of my analysis is to provide insights about android applications and their categories.I want to deep dive in data for the factors of influences on an application, to know why and how certain applications succeed and others. Also, what is required for an application to be considered as successfully topping the charts.
